                <h3>Our beginning</h3>
                <p>A single parent faces a myriad of issues. For a single parent, having access to basic necessities is especially important when babies are at their growing phase. However, the cost of raising babies has been exponentially increasing in the recent years. The cost of raising a baby aged 0-2 in Singapore can amount to a whopping $60000 due to the high costs of basic essentials. For single parents, being able to afford such a large amount of money is extremely difficult. Furthermore, the Covid-19 situation has exacerbated this issue as many working adults have lost their jobs or have been receiving salary cuts. As such, through our website, we hope to reduce the financial burden of these single parents by providing them an avenue to get free baby products easily </p>
